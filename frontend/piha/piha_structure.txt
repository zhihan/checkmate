The data structure for each field is described below.

(1) Hyperplanes
---------------

Threshold hyperplanes from all PTHBs and the analysis region AR are collected 
in this field. The field is a cell array of hyperplane structures, each with 
the following format

   Hyperplanes{i}.pthb  : -1 if it belongs to analysis region AR, otherwise
                          it is the index to the parent PTHB in PTHBlocks
   Hyperplanes{i}.index : The hyperplane index within the parent PTHB
   Hyperplanes{i}.c     : Vector and constant pair representing the hyperplane
   Hyperplanes{i}.d     : c*x = d
  
(2) NAR
-------

region boundary. The first NAR hyperplanes in the Hyperplanes list are the 
hyperplanes from the analysis region.

(3) InitialContinuousSet
------------------------

continuous set

element) is a vector of state indices for FSMBlocks in the same order as in 
FSMBlocks list.

(5) Cells
---------

A cell array of "cells" in the partition of the continuous state space. Each 
cell is a structure of the following format

   Cells{i}.boundary  : A vector of indices to hyperplanes in Hyperplanes list 
                        that comprises the boundary of the ith cell.
   Cells{i}.hpflags   : A vector of the same length as the Hyperplanes list.
                        hpflags(j) is a boolean flag indicating the side of
                        the jth hyperplane in Hyperplanes list in which the 
                        cell lies. Specifically,
                           hpflags(j) = 1 --> c_j*x <= d_j
                           hpflags(j) = 0 --> c_j*x >= d_j
                        for any x in the ith cell.
   Cells{i}.pthflags  : A vector of the same length as the PTHBlocks list 
			(simulink diagram). pthflags(j) is a boolean flag 
			indicating the output value of the jth PTHB in 
			PTHBlocks list for any x in the ith cell.
 			 0 --> point x generates zero  at the jth PTHB
 			 1 --> point x generates one  at the jth PTHB

                              which there is no transition out of any
                              of the component states), then

                              For each regular location transition, 
                              transition{j} contains an element with the 
                              following field values
