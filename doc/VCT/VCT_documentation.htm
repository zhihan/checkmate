<h1>The Variable Cam Timing System</h1>

<p>The VCT system is an automotive application in
which a computer controlled hydraulic actuator is used to vary the
phase of the cam shaft of an engine with respect to its crankshaft.
The controller's task is to regulate the position of the actuator to a
given setpoint.  The controller has three modes: one in which standard
PID control is employed, one in which the controller output is
saturated high, and one in which it is saturated low.  The property to
be verified is that no more than one mode transition should ever be
taken.  Figure 1 shows an overview of the VCT system.</p>

<p>The controller is a switched-mode, computer controller, meaning that its output 
is governed by a set of difference equations where the mode of the controller 
determines the difference equations that are used.  In order to analyze this type
of system, that is, a switched-mode computer controller that is controlling a 
continuous time plant, sampled data reachability analysis is employed.  This is a
special type of reachability analysis that exploits the sampled data nature of the
problem.</p>

<p>Note that 3 versions of the VCT system appear in the current release of CheckMate.
  One of the models illustrates the system passing the
verification test for one set of initial conditions.  However, the system does not satisfy the
requirements for every set of initial conditions, so a second model illustrates the
system failing the verification test for another set of initial conditions.  A third
model illustrates a nonlinear version of the VCT system.</p>
 
<p>Figure 3 illustrates the behavior of the VCT system in simulation.  The simulation 
begins with the controller in saturation mode.  At some point near 20 ms, the controller
switches modes to the PID control mode and remains there.  This is the desired 
behavior of the system.</p>

<h2>The CheckMate Model</h2>

<p>Figure 3 shows the top level CheckMate model of the VCT system.  The switching conditions
are given by the (green) polyhedral threshold blocks (PTHB's), the mode switching takes 
place inside the Stateflow block (in yellow), and the difference equation behavior of the controller
, as well as the differential equations governing the plant, take place in the 
switched continuous system block (the SCSB in blue).</p>

<p>Notice also the variable zero order
hold (VZOH) block (with the clock picture).  This block provides sampling pulses to
the Stateflow block and the SCSB.  Figure 4 shows the VZOH dialogue box.  The period is given
by a row vector of length 2, where both elements of the vector are the period 
(e.g., period=[.1 .1]).  The VZOH block will eventually be extended so that the elements
of the period field will represent a range of sample periods for which the system
can be analyzed, but currently, only a single sample period is supported.  Similarly,
Initial Displacement and Periodic Jitter are not currently supported, and so their
values must be set to phase=[0 0] and jitter=[0 0].</p>

<p>Also notice the step input that is connected to both the VZOH
block and the Stateflow block in figure 3.  This provides the initial impulse that is needed
to begin the simulation. </p> 
 
<p>Figure 5 shows the dialogue box for the SCSB.  Note that the "Perform Sampled-
Data Difference Equation Analysis" box is checked.  This tells CheckMate that the
system dynamics will be specified as both continuous time differential equations
and discrete time difference equations.  The dialogue box also specifies the number
of continuous time states, the number of discrete time states, and the number of 
controller outputs.  The initial conditions are specified as the continuous time 
states concatenated with the discrete time states (e.g., [x_c1;x_d1;x_d2] ).</p>

<h2>Specifying System Dynamics for Switched Mode Computer Controlled Systems</h2> 
<p>As with other CheckMate models, the system dynamics are specified in user defined
m-files.  For the sampled data case,  the user defined function returns the state
derivatives, controller update equations, and the type of
continuous system.  The function is provided a controller/plant discrete state (an integer, u), and 
it returns a vector representing the continuous-time state variable derivatives along with the
discrete-time update equations for the controller states and outputs.  The input
vector x is assumed to have the form:</p>
    
<b>x = [ x ; z ]   </b>
    
<p>where x is the continuous state-vector (the plant state),
z is the discrete-time state vector (the controller state).</p>

<p>The output vector, sys, is assumed to have the following form:</p>

<b>sys = [ dx/dt ; z(n+1) ]</b>

<p>The continuous time derivatives of z are assumed to be zero.  So the continuous variables evolve
during a sample period.  Then the z variables are updated at the next sample instant.
For the linear case, reachability makes use of the A and b matrices for the plant and controller.
In this case, sys should have the following structure:</p>

<b>sys.A  = plant A matrix<br>
sys.b  = plant b matrix<br>
sys.r  = plant r vector<br>
sys.C  = plant C matrix<br>
sys.Ap = controller state A matrix<br>
sys.bp = controller state b matrix<br>
sys.rp = controller state r vector<br>
sys.Cp = controller C matrix<br>
sys.Dp = controller D matrix<br>
sys.rpp= controller output r vector<br></b>

<p>where the system equations are assumed to be:</p>

<b>dxp/dt = A*x+b*up+r<br>
    <br>
y = C*x<br>
     <br>
z(n+1) = Ap*z(n)+bp*y+rp<br>
     <br>
up(n) = Cp*z(n)+Dp*y(n)+rpp<br></b>
     
<p>For the nonlinear case, the input vector x is assumed to have the form:</p>
     
 <b>  x = [ x ; z ; up]  </b>  
     
 <p>where x is the continuous state-vector (the plant state),
 z is the discrete-time state vector (the controller state), and up is the controller output vector.</p>
 
<p> The output vector, sys, is assumed to have the following form:</p>
 
<b>sys = [ dx/dt ; z(n+1) ; up(n)]</b>
 
 
 <p>Again, the continuous time derivatives of z are assumed to be zero.  So the continuous variables evolve
 during a sample period.  Then the z variables are updated at the next sample instant.</p>

<h2>The Verification</h2>
<p>Again, the VCT system does not satisfy the given property for all possible
initial conditions.  Using discrete time reachability analysis, however, we can
identify sets of initial conditions for which the system does satisfy the
given property and sets of initial conditions for which the system
never satisfies the property.</p>

<p>Figure 6 illustrates the reachability analysis performed on the VCT system.  The 
figure shows the projection of the reachset onto two of the three dimensions.  
The reachability analysis is performed twice:  once for a set of initial conditions
that pass the verification test and once for a set that does not. </p> 

<p>The set of initial conditions labeled "Safe ICS" propagate into the PID mode, switching 
modes exactly once, and enter a Lyapunov ellipsoid (i.e., a region of the state 
space that, once entered, the system is guaranteed to never leave), which is 
found automatically by CheckMate.  In this case, 
we know that the requirement that the system switch modes exactly once is satisfied 
for all <i>t</i>.  </p>

<p>The set of initial conditions labeled "Unsafe ICS" propagate into the PID mode, then
back into the Sat Low mode, and then end up in the PID mode, for a total of 2 mode
switches.  This clearly illustrates a set of initial conditions for which the 
system fails the specification.</p>
