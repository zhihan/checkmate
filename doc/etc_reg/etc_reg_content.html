<h1>The ETC Regulation Control Problem</h1>

This example demonstrates the application of CheckMate to verify
properties of a hybrid system with ranges of values for the
initial state and parameters in the system model. The
requirements given for the <a href=
"http://vehicle.me.berkeley.edu/mobies/powertrain/">MoBIES OEP
page</a> can be shown to either
hold or not hold by simulation studies for particular initial
conditions and parameter values. For example, simulations of the
CheckMate model of the ETC system in the demo example <a href="../etc5d/ETC5.htm"
target="_parent">ETC5D</a> show that the transient response never
violates the rise-time specifications, even for cases when the throttle 
spring constant and equilibrim position deviate from their nominal
values by 20%.

<p>In this example we demonstrate verification of the requirement
that the throttle angle should not exceed a 5% band around
the steady state value of the reference signal after the transient
phase of a step response. Simulations such as the one
shown in Figure  1 demonstrate that this
property is satisfied for a finite-time horizon for the nominal
values of the system parameters. The objective here is to show that
the specification is satisfied for a range of possible values for 
the throttle spring constant and equilibrim position.  Our approach
is to show that, starting from a range of initial states corresponding to the end of the 
transient phase of the system step reponse, the sliding mode 
defined in <a href="../etc5d/ETC5.htm" target="_parent">ETC5d
demo</a> is reached.</p>

<h2>The CheckMate Model</h2>

<p>The structure of this model is the same as the model
described in the other <a href="../etc5d/ETC5.htm" target=
"_parent">ETC demo</a>. Futher infomation may be found in this <a
href="tryout.ppt">powerpoint presentation</a>.</p>

<p>In this model, we assume that
the reference signal has reached its steady state value, and can
therefore omit the reference signal filter. Consequently, the CheckMate model has 
only two state variables,
the throttle angle &alpha; and the angular velocity &omega;.  The sliding surface, which is defined by
<em>s=&lambda;(&alpha;-u<sub>f</sub>) + (&omega;-u'<sub>f</sub>
)</em>, becomes <em>s=&lambda;(&alpha;-&alpha;<sub>des</sub>) +
&omega;</em>. Similarly, other occurrences of the filter in the
etc5d model are replaced. All other hyperplanes and thresholds in
the higher dimensional ETC model were already expressed in
&alpha; and &omega; only.</p>

<p>Analyzing the system dynamics and the trajectories from the
initial conditions, it is possible to identify a region where all
the trajectories pass through. By enlarging this region we have a
conservative approximation for the reachable region, starting at
the initial set. The enlarged reached region is called <i>outer
box</i>. The rationale is that the set should, for example, be
reached by all trajectories from the initial after a step change
to the desired angle. By using the <i>outer box</i> as the
initial set for the verification procedure, one can focus on the
behavior that is close to the region where the system can
potentially violate the requirements (&alpha; &gt;
1.05&alpha;<sub>des</sub>). Figure 2 shows the trajectories for
the vertices of the initial set, for the full-dimensional case,
where all of them cross the <i>outer box</i>. Figure 3 shows the
crossing in detail.</p>

<p>Once the trajectories enter the region between the sliding
surfaces, a region called <i>middle box</i>, it is necessary to
show that all the trajectories starting in the <i>middle box</i>
go to the steady state, without violating the requirements. This
investigation can be done by verification or by observing that
the vector field inside the <i>middle box</i> points towards the steady
state region, which combined with the robustness of the sliding
mode behavior is sufficient to guarantee that all trajectories
go eventually to the steady state. The <i>middle box</i> region
will be used as the termination criterion for the
verification.</p>

<p>In addition to the thresholds for the sliding surface and
coulomb friction we define the <i>middle box</i> neighborhood as
another region. The objective of this region is to show that if
the system leaves a pre-defined initial condition set it will
enter the <i>middle box</i></p>

<p>We add to the file <code>setup2_reg.m</code> the definition of
the <i>outer box</i> and <i>middle box</i>. They are defined as
follows:</p>

<pre>
C_outer = [1 0;-1 0;0 1;0 -1];
d_outer = [alpha_des*1.04;-alpha_des*1.003;-0.1;0.2]];
assignin('base','etc_ICS',linearcon([],[],C_outer,d_outer));
</pre>

<pre>
C_middle = [-60 -1];
d_middle = -94.0883;
assignin('base','middle',linearcon([],[],C_middle,d_middle));
</pre>

<p>Note that the <i>outer box</i> will be defined as the initial
set. The <i>middle box</i> will be represented only by one face of the
sliding surface, since the dynamics crosses this face first. The
simplified <i>CheckMate</i> model will have only one SFM block,
called <i>state</i>. In this model, the discrete states model the
transitions for the coulomb friction (called left, neither and
right) and there is a final state called reach, if the trajectory
reaches the <i>middle box</i>. There is no need to specify an ACTL
formula; CheckMate will generate the necessary property by
itself. Recall from the other demo's that we name a location
<code>reach</code> if each trajectory has to eventually reach the
location. <a href="#fig2">Figure 4</a> shows the part that was
included to verify the property.</p>

<h2>The Verification</h2>

<p>Figure 5 shows the flowpipe segments that were
computed during the verification. The red box is the initial set,
the green box is the neighborhood of the sliding surface that has
to be reached.</p>

diagonal box.</center>

<p>The verification shows that the state do always reach the
sliding surface. While running the verification one might
encounter the following warning:</p>

<pre>
Warning: Optimization did not improve the results of the convex hull approximation during reachability analysis.
</pre>

This warning tells the user that the optimization in <a href=
"#step3">step 3</a> did not yield a better result than the convex
hull approximation of the simulated points and vertices, for a
particular face (<a href="#step2">step 2</a>). In this case the
optimization was not able to improve the result. In all other
cases, however, simulation did not provide a conservative
approximation, and using optimization did improve the result. 

<p>Finally, since the verification works out as planned, you
might see the following output:</p>

<pre>
    Parsing specification 1: (AG ~out_of_bound)&amp;(AF state == reach)
Compiling list of atomic propositions.
 * out_of_bound
 * state_in_reach

Making refinement decision.

System enters the state "reach" in all cases.

total verification time is 194.92 seconds.
&gt;&gt;
</pre>

We can therefore conclude that the system did not leave the
analysis region, and that the system reaches the sliding surface
in all cases.

<h2>Background on Parametric Verification</h2>

<p>CheckMate allows the user to specify uncertainty ranges on
parameters for the continuous dynamics.  In this ETC demo we have
selected the spring constant and the spring equilibrium as uncertain
parameters. We assume that both may deviate with 20% from their
nominal values. Both parameters have an influence on how the system
behaves close to the steady state. </p>

<p>Parameters are incorporated into the verification precedure
during the computation of the flowpipe approximations. 
The flowpipe approximation starts from an initial set of states (a polyhedron)
in the continuous state space. As a first step, each vertex of the initial set
is simulated up to a predefined time &Delta;t. In the parametric
case, this simulation is performed for all vertices of the
polyhedron that defines the set of possible parameter values, as well as for 
the vertices of the initial state set. This is illustrated in the figure below, 
where the polyhedron represents the initial set of states and the points
represent the results of simulating the system for the vertices in both the
state set and the parameter set.</p>

<center><a name="step1"></a> <img src=
"etc_reg_documentation_files/step1.JPG" alt="step1"></center>

<p>The next step is to determine the convex hull of
the simulation points and the vertices of the initial state set, as illustrated
in the following figure. This step is mainly done to obtain the normals on the faces.
These directions are used get an over-approximation of the
reachable set. </p>

<center><a name="step2"></a><img src=
"etc_reg_documentation_files/step2.JPG" alt="step2"></center>

<p>The third and last step, illustrated below, is to push the faces in
the direction of its normal, such that the face will become a
tangent plane of the reachable set. The flowpipe approximation
uses an optimization routine to do so.</p>

<center><a name="step3"></a><img src=
"etc_reg_documentation_files/step3.JPG" alt="step3"></center>

<p>The optimization, given a non-parametric system, is performed
over all initial states and all times within the interval t and
t+&Delta;t. To obtain the flowpipe for a parametric model one has
to optimize over the parameter range, too. This means for the ETC
example in this demo, that the optimization problems are
5-dimensional, two dimensions for the states, two for the parameters 
and one time dimension.</p>
